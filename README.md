# house-price-prediction
My first Machine learning project on predicting the house prices, using a basic dataset.
In this notebook, I have created a RandomForestRegressor model, using scikit-learn package. This represents a basic model of how ML algorithms work. I have used a pre-defined dataset of the House Price details in India, imported from Kaggle.
